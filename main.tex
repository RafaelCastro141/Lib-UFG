    \section{Convex Hull Trick}
        \subsection{Convex Hull Trick 1}
        This solutions only works when the coeficients are all increasing / decreasing, and the queries decreasing / increasing. Improve $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$. (Original Problem: Codeforces - Round 189 (Div. 1) C)
        \lstinputlisting{./solutions/ConvexHull1.cpp}
        \subsection{Convex Hull Trick 2}
        This solutions works under the same conditions for Convex Hull Trick 1, but it's used to solve problems in a 2D dinamic programming, like problem NKLEAVES from spoj. In resume we need to group $N$ leaves in $K$ groups, for each coordinate between 1 and $N$ there is a leaf with weight $w_i$, and the leaves can only be moved to the left, and the cost is $w_i * d$ where $d$ is the distance that leaf $i$ was moved. The problem asks for minimum cost to group the $N$ leaves in $K$ groups. Lets reverse the leaves weights, now the leafs can only be moved to the right.
        
        So, the recurrence is:
        
        \bigskip
        
        $dp_{i, j} = \min_{k \leq i} ( (\sum_{p=k}^{i} (i - p) * w_p) + dp_{k - 1, j - 1})$, clearly $O(n^2k)$
        
        \bigskip
        
        So we will keep our lines in such way, that we can solve this problem, see the code below. 
        
        This solutions only works when the coeficients are all increasing / decreasing, and the queries decreasing / increasing. Improve $O(n^2k)$ to $O(nk)$. (Original Problem: SPOJ - NKLEAVES)

    \section{Line Sweep}
        \subsection{Points Inside Triangles}
        Given $n$ triangles with vertices {($x_i$, $y_i$), ($x_i + d$, $y_i$), ($x_i$, $y_i + d$)}, and $q$ points, compute for each triangle, the number of points that lie inside or in boundary of him. $O(nlogn)$. (Original Problem: CODECHEF - TRIANGULAR QUERIES)
        \lstinputlisting{./solutions/PointsInsideTriangles.cpp}
        \subsection{Ranking Problem}
        Given $n$ students that attended to $3$ contests, and all of them have different ranks, between $1$ and $n$ inclusive, for each contest. We say that one student $a$ is better that student $b$, if all ranks of student $a$ in each contest is lesser that student $b$. A student is said to be excellent if no other student is better than him. How many excelent students there exists ?
        
        This solutions runs in $O(nlogn)$. (Original Problem: SPOJ: NICEDAY)

        \subsection{Balls Falls and Segments}
        Given $n$ segments (non horizontal and with no common points), and $m$ balls in a 2D plane, say for each ball the x point which he falls.
        
        This solutions runs in $O(nlogn)$ but i used some Fraction class to take care with double error precisions, so the overall solution in this case is $O(nlogn^2)$. Original Problem (UVa - Water Falls).

        \subsection{Checking Points Inside Convex Polygon}
            \subsubsection{Offline}
            Given $n$ points in 2D plane, and a Convex Polygon, check for each of these $n$ points, if them are strict inside or not of polygon.
            
            This solutions runs in $O(nlogn)$ but i used Fracion Class to Take Care with double error precisions, so the overall solution in this case is $O(nlogn^2)$.

            \subsubsection{Online}
            Given one point and a Convex Polygon, with vertices in counter clockwise order, check if this point is inside or in boundary of him.
            
            This solutions runs in $O(logn)$.

        \subsection{Area of Rectangles Union}
        Given a set of N axis aligned rectangles, you need to find the area of their union. Each rectangle is represented by two points, one lower-left point and one upper-right point. The coordinates are all integers.
        
        This solutions runs in $O(nlogn)$. Original Problem (HackerEarth - Line Sweep Tutorial, Sample Exercicise)
    \section{Minimum Perimeter Triangle}
    Given $n$ points in a 2D plane, return the minimum perimeter that can be formed taking three points, collinear points are allowed. $O(nlogn)$. (Original Problem - Google Code Jam WF 2009 - B)
